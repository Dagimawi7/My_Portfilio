            I'm a final-year Computer Science student and aspiring full-stack
            software engineer. I've interned at Goldman Sachs and Kainos, where I
            learned about scalable backend systems and meaningful software design.
            <br /><br />
            I enjoy building full-stack apps using React, Node.js, and cloud
            services. I love solving complex problems and turning ideas into real,
            working applications.
